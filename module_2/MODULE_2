## 2-1 What is Images & Containers?

- Container is an unit of software
- Images VS Container
  container is The running 'unit of software'
  image is the templates/blueprints for container
  image contains code + required tools/runtimes
  multiple containers can be created based on one image
  image is the read only
  image has code and environment
  we can create read and write within container, we can change code within container.

# Docker Image vs Container

| Aspect       | Docker Image                                          | Docker Container                              |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Definition   | A template or blueprint for creating containers       | A running instance of a Docker image          |
| Nature       | Read-only                                             | Read and write                                |
| Content      | Contains application code and required tools/runtimes | Contains the running code and environment     |
| Usage        | Used to create one or more containers                 | Executes the application using an image       |
| Modification | Cannot be modified after it's built                   | Can be modified during runtime                |
| Persistence  | Persistent and reusable template                      | Temporary by default, unless volumes are used |
| Number       | One image can spawn multiple containers               | Each container is an isolated instance        |

## 2-2 Using Pre-built Images

### Finding/Creating Image

- we need an image
- we can get image in two ways:
  1.  prebuilt image (via docker hub)
  2.  write your own custom image (write your own dockerfile - based on another image)
- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
